/**
 * This regex extracts the attribute name preceding an attribute-position
 * expression. It does this by matching the syntax allowed for attributes
 * against the string literal directly preceding the expression, assuming that
 * the expression is in an attribute-value position.
 *
 * See attributes in the HTML spec:
 * https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#elements-attributes
 *
 * " \x09\x0a\x0c\x0d" are HTML space characters:
 * https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#space-characters
 *
 * "\0-\x1F\x7F-\x9F" are Unicode control characters, which includes every
 * space character except " ".
 *
 * So an attribute is:
 *  * The name: any character except a control character, space character, ('),
 *    ("), ">", "=", or "/"
 *  * Followed by zero or more space characters
 *  * Followed by "="
 *  * Followed by zero or more space characters
 *  * Followed by:
 *    * Any character except space, ('), ("), "<", ">", "=", (`), or
 *    * (") then any non-("), or
 *    * (') then any non-(')
